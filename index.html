          The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been the foundation of
          communication on the World Wide Web for over three decades. This
          website explores how HTTP evolved from its early forms to modern,
          secure, and high-performance versions that power today’s web.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p class="content">
          The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main communication
          protocol that enables data exchange on the World Wide Web. As a
          client-server protocol, HTTP allows web browsers and other
          applications to request resources like HTML documents, images, videos,
          and scripts from servers, which then respond accordingly (<em
            >MDN Web Docs, n.d.-a</em
          >). This mechanism allows people to interact with and transfer
          information around the web smoothly. Over time, HTTP has evolved from
          a simple protocol into a more flexible framework that supports modern
          web applications, interactive services, and secure communications.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          Since the early 1990s, HTTP has undergone significant changes to make
          it faster and more secure. Early versions, such as HTTP/0.9 and
          HTTP/1.0, mainly focused on sending basic documents. But as the web
          expanded, these versions quickly showed their limits. The subsequent
          development of HTTP/1.1 solved many of these problems by introducing
          persistent connections, enhanced caching, and standard headers.
          Because of these improvements, it became the first widely adopted
          version of the protocol (<em>W3C, 1999</em>). These steps show not
          only how HTTP itself developed but also how the needs of web users,
          companies, and developers have changed.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          The purpose of this website is to explore the evolution of HTTP by
          looking at its history, role in building the web, current status, and
          future directions. By following this path, it will show how HTTP has
          shaped and continues to shape the modern internet.
